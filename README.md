# Parking LOt System
The parking lot is a “last-in, first-out” stack. When parking a car,
the program must first check to see if the car has the correct decal. 
If it does have the correct permit, the car may be added to the lot as long as there is enough room. 
To park a car, the car’s license tag is added to the parking lot stack. The parking lot can hold 10 cars at a time. 
If the parking lot is full, a waiting car can be added to a waiting queue. 
When a car leaves the lot, the next car in the queue will be able to park in the parking lot. 
program models this behavior, using one stack for the driveway.
A queue will be used to store the cars waiting for a place to park of the lot is full
Using integers as license plate numbers.
If the stack representing the parking lot is full, the car waiting should be added to the queue.
There is also a VIP parking area having a specific decal. Hashing is used for this lot.
So this Whole parking lot code is using three data structures Stack, Queue, Hashing.
